# CLAPSY
It is always a pleasure to visit one of my first projects (Yes, for me at that time, It was like a Real Project :p)
CLAPSY is an interactive CLI game build by Python

# Knowledge used there:
- Object Oriented Programming (Class, constructor, method, object)
- tesing (raise a ValueError Exception) 
- Separate the project into two files (the Class and the main program)
- If Else elif statement
- Use format syntax in print call
- Use an external library (datetime)
